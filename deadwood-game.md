# Deadwood Game

With one other person (Adrian) and myself, we collaborated to implement the Deadwood Card Game into a playable program with a graphical user interface. While working on the project, I learned and applied object-oriented code designs such as Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Singleton. Additionally, I learned the importance of high cohesion and low coupling in coding a project. This project was mainly coded with Java and JavaFX.
