# Haunting of Wilson Game

With one other person (Katie) and myself, we collaborated to create our own original stealth-horror game based on the Wilson Library at Western Washington University. We implemented cool player interactions and complex AI, and constructed an immersive experience through animations, lighting, and sound. This project was mainly coded with the Unity Game Engine and C#.

## Game Premise

You are a student trapped in the haunted Wilson Library, trying to escape before the spirits catch you. To win you must navigate the floors of the library and make it to the north entrance without being detected by the ghosts haunting the building. If you are caught by any of the enemies patrolling the library, you lose.
